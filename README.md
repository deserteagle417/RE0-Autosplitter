# RE0-Autosplitter

## Door Splits

There are three routes available in the door splitter:
* New Game
* New Game + & Wesker Mode
* A basic door splitter that will split on every door transition. (These will split on doors even if you misroute, so use at your own 
discretion. This option might be interesting to you if you are doing a non-standard route.)

Note that Event Splits and the Train cutscene split will not function if door splits are used. This is to prevent double splitting.

## Item Splits

Autosplits are available for every key item pickup and can be customized to split on whichever items you choose.

## Event Splits

Event Splits match up best with the older autosplitters and are designed to be usable with (most) existing sets of splits. In the autosplitter
settings, hover over each item to see what each one is splitting at.
